# Implementation-of-Load-Balancer-Algorithms
 Implementation of effective load balancing algorithms that can optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and ensure high availability.

# How Load Balancing Works : 
 A load balancer acts as a traffic cop, sitting between clients and backend servers. It intercepts incoming requests, evaluates the health and load of backend servers, and directs each request to the most appropriate server for processing. Load balancers use various algorithms to distribute traffic, such as round-robin, least connections etc.

# Load Balancing Algorithms : 
 There are various load balancing algorithms that determine how traffic is distributed across backend servers. Some common algorithms include:
 
Round-robin: This is the simplest algorithm, which distributes traffic to servers in a sequential order.

Least connections: This algorithm directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
